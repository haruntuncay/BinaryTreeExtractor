# BinaryTreeExtractor
Extracts a binary tree from specially formatted string and exports it as a png file representing the tree.

The string format looks like the example below:

    daa(baa(caa)(aaa))(faa(kaa)(eaa))

Which represents the tree below: (where "d" is the root node)


                                daa                                                              
                baa                              faa                              
        caa              aaa              kaa              eaa
